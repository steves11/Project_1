When is it appropriate to use containers in cloud deployments, and what are the security benefits of doing so?


 It is appropriate to use containers in cloud deployment when you want to to build, test, deploy, and redeploy applications on multiple environments. Containers allow you to easily build and tear down an environment without having to set up any hardware. They also allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled. In our project we downloaded multiple containers. Some of the containers we downloaded were dvwa and elk stalk. For the project we download dvwa on two VMS web-1 web-2, which its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment. We also  integrated an ELK server that allowed us to monitor the vulnerable VMS for changes to the files and system traffic. There are many security benefits when using containers. You can monitor traffic and logs on your network without having to buy more equipment. The applications in containers will run the same, regardless of where they are deployed, so you have consistency and if there is any errors security professionals can quickly rebuild without wasting much money. Containers do not use images so it saves on memory. Also with containers you can use IAC to run any security implication you may need,(patching, scaling) which it benefits you because there could be less results in human error. Many companies today are switching over to cloud environments, its easier because you can only scale up so much and cloud allows you to scale up and down depending on the companies needs.
